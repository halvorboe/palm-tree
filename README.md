# PalmTree OS

Imagine that you're stuck on a desert island and you're only option to escape is an eithernet cable leading to the mainland and an x86 computer without an operating system. What is the minimal OS needed to connect to the internet.

This chances of this project being completed are low, but hopefully I'll learn something along the way.

## Starting point

I've looked around for minimal OS implementations. I want to write my OS in Rust. I'm basing it of the example in:

https://os.phil-opp.com/
https://github.com/rust-osdev/uart_16550

## Goals
- [X] Rust code prints to the screen.
- [X] Able to handle input.
- [ ] Basic OS up and running.
- [ ] Networking stack.
- [ ] Able to load example.com to the screen.
